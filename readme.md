# Minor UX tweaks for FoundryVTT

Note: this module is written for my personal preferences and is not tested with any other system or modules I am personally using.
The list of modules I use changes every couple of days, so I'm not going to provide them here.
I only play D&D5e at the moment.

Everything mentioned below is available in different files, so feel free to copy-paste whatever you like.

## Installing

1. Copy the manifest url: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/didii/foundryvtt-minor-ux/master/module.json>
2. Click on install module in Foundry and paste the manifest url in the input field

## Minor QoL improvements

### Highlight

Only tested with the [minor QoL module](https://gitlab.com/tposney/minor-qol).
Tweaks some buttons to show a red or green box shadow when Ctrl or Alt is pressed.

Currently it affects the following:

Chat buttons:

Inventory buttons:

## Calendar/Weather improvements

Only useful with the [Calendar/Weather](https://github.com/DasSauerkraut/calendar-weather) module.

The buttons of the calendar are black, behind it is a black transparent box and when the map is also dark, the buttons are practically invisible.
This only changes the buttons to be grayish white so that they are always properly visible.
